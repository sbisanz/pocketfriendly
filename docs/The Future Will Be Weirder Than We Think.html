                                    <p>How weird is the future going to be? Just a little bit — or plain flat-out radically unthinkably weird? And is this future 1,000 years from now — or 100?</p><p>The notion that the future will be weirder than we think, and come sooner, is a possibility <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/all-possible-views-about-humanitys-future-are-wild/">raised</a> by Holden Karnofsky, the co-chief executive officer of Open Philanthropy. It’s an intriguing and provocative idea.</p>
